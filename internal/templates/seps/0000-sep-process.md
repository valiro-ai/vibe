# SEP-0000: Enhancement Proposal Process

## What & Why

SEPs (Software Enhancement Proposals) are numbered documents that track features from idea to implementation. They provide a lightweight way to organize work and maintain commit history.

**Roles:**
- **Authors**: Draft SEPs - anyone on the team
- **Editors**: Review, give feedback, approve SEPs
- **Pilots**: Implement approved SEPs with AI agents

**Key principle**: Trust the AI to know how to build software. SEPs specify *what* to build, not *how*.

## Process

1. **Create**: `vibe sep new "Feature Name"` creates a numbered SEP file
2. **Draft**: Fill in what you want, when it's done, and what areas it affects
3. **Coordinate**: `vibe sep pipeline` shows conflicts for pilot coordination
4. **Plan**: `/sep-plan XXXX` analyzes codebase and creates implementation plan
5. **Review**: Editor/pilot reviews the plan
6. **Implement**: `/sep-implement XXXX` executes the plan
7. **Track**: `vibe sep status` shows progress

## States

- **DRAFT**: Being written, awaiting editor review
- **ACCEPTED**: Editor approved, ready for implementation
- **BLOCKED**: Can't proceed (add reason in SEP)
- **CANCELLED**: Decided not to build
- **DONE**: Built and shipped

## SEP Template

```markdown
---
title: "Feature Name"
status: DRAFT
created: 2025-01-01
depends_on: []
areas:
  - internal/auth/*
  - api/routes/login.go
assigned: ""
---

# SEP-XXXX: Feature Name

## What & Why

[Explain the feature and why you want it]

## Done When

- [ ] Acceptance criteria 1
- [ ] Acceptance criteria 2

---

## Plan

*Generated by `/sep-plan` - review before implementation*

---

## Implementation Notes

*Added during `/sep-implement`*
```

## Areas (Pilot Coordination)

The `areas` field lists files/directories the SEP will modify. This helps pilots avoid merge conflicts when working in parallel.

```yaml
areas:
  - internal/user/*      # All files in internal/user/
  - api/routes/auth.go   # Specific file
  - cmd/server/*         # Server command files
```

Use `vibe sep pipeline` to see conflicts:

```
SEP Pipeline - Area Conflicts
==================================================

DRAFT:
  SEP-0001: User Authentication
    areas: internal/auth/*, api/routes/login.go

  SEP-0002: User Profiles ⚠️  CONFLICT with SEP-0001
    areas: internal/user/*, api/routes/profile.go

--------------------------------------------------
⚠️  Conflicts detected:
  SEP-0001 ↔ SEP-0002: internal/user/*

→ Implement conflicting SEPs sequentially or coordinate pilots
```

## Commit Messages

Reference the SEP number in every commit:

```
SEP-0004: Add notification model
SEP-0004: Implement API endpoints
SEP-0004: Add tests
```

## Quick Reference

```bash
# CLI (vibe)
vibe sep new "Feature"       # Create new SEP
vibe sep list                # List all SEPs
vibe sep status              # Check progress + next action
vibe sep sync                # Pull + show pipeline
vibe sep claim XXXX @pilot   # Claim SEP (assign + commit + push)
vibe sep pipeline            # Show areas + conflicts + assignments
vibe sep update XXXX DONE    # Update status
vibe feedback "message"      # Submit feedback
vibe feedback list           # View feedback

# Claude commands
/sep-discuss XXXX          # Refine requirements
/sep-plan XXXX             # Create implementation plan
/sep-implement XXXX        # Execute the plan
/sep-split XXXX            # Break up large SEP
/sep-suggest               # AI suggests new SEP ideas
```
